- Various hacks to make Type::Constraint objects play nice with Moose. Needs
  changes to Moose to work properly, however.

- The message generator sub is no longer called as a method, it is simply
  called as a sub, so it doesn't receive the type as an argument.

- The inline environment variable names used for each type are unique so types
  will not step on each other if you want to inline more than one type check
  in the same scope.

- Non-inlined type coercions were completely broken.

- Added $type->is_same_type_as and $type->is_a_type_of methods.

- The Maybe type was a subtype of Ref in the code, which is wrong. It is now a
  subtype of Item.

- This module now explicitly requires Perl 5.10.

- Now with lots more documentation, but this is still very alpha. Feedback
  from potential users is welcome.

- First release upon an unsuspecting world. This is very alpha and subject to
  change. I'm mostly releasing it to get some feedback on the design. Do not
  use this in your code yet, unless you promise not to complain about the lack
  of docs or the fact that the next release breaks your code.

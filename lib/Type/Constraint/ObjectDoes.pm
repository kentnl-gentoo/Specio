# ABSTRACT: A class for constraints which require an object that does a specific role



=pod

=head1 NAME

Type::Constraint::ObjectDoes - A class for constraints which require an object that does a specific role

=head1 VERSION

version 0.04

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  my $type = Type::Constraint::ObjectDoes->new(...);
  print $type->role();

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is a specialized type constraint class for types which require an object
that does a specific role.

=head1 API

This class provides all of the same methods as L<Type::Constraint::Simple>,
with a few differences:

=head2 Type::Constraint::ObjectDoes->new( ... )

The C<parent> parameter is ignored if it passed, as it is always set to the
C<Defined> type.

The C<inline_generator> and C<constraint> parameters are also ignored. This
class provides its own default inline generator subroutine reference.

This class overrides the C<message_generator> default if none is provided.

Finally, this class requires an additional parameter, C<role>. This must be a
single role name.

=head2 $object_isa->role()

Returns the role name passed to the constructor.

=head1 ROLES

This class does the L<Type::Constraint::Role::DoesType>,
L<Type::Constraint::Role::Interface>, L<Type::Role::Inlinable>, and
L<MooseX::Clone> roles.
